  <h1>Writing</h1>
  <p>8/1/2024</p>
  <p>"Writing is nature's way of letting you know that you how sloppy you thinking is" - Guindon</p>
  <p>
    Recently I watched one of Leslie Lamport's presentations about coding. He talks bout why we write. We write to think. I want to think. Thus, I must write.

    I think that this quote is impactful because I have experience that a lot myself. I told myself that I understand something but then my understanding was not as good as I thought it was. Writing things down is the ultimate teller of the truth. I can keep deluding myself that I know what I am doing and thinking and talking about but this can never be verified unless I write it down. Also, who knows? Maybe this will make me a better thinker, problem solver, and learner. Why not try :shrug:.

    Another thing that I have been interested in recently is Avatar the Last Airbender. I vaguely remember watching this show as a kid, but this never really was that special in my memories. However, now with this rewatch, I began to appreciate it a bit more. It is amusing to see a lot of the plot points and guessing at what will happen in the future. It kind of reminds me of the sterile problems we are handed in school. The problems are well constructed and guide you towards the answer and you can tell that someone put a lot of effort to make it instructive. Playing around with this idea made me realize that in a way, creative story wrtiting is a lot like coding. There are a lot of different levels of abstractions and each of them affect each other. For example, the way you phrase your sentences (at the writing technique level) affects the perception of your characters (at the per character level). Each of the individual characters combined with the way that they interact affects the way that the world is percieved (at the story level). This was kind of a poor description but I hope the idea is there. It takes a lot of problem solving to make sure that the story goes just rightm which feels exactly like coding.

    I have also wanted to be a bit more creative. I have tried many times to do something creative but it usually falls short. Who knows, maybe it will work this time.
  </p>
  <p>
    For these reasons, I am going to try to write a little bit. Maybe what I put here will be not exactly writing, but I want to produce something instead of always consuming. Every week for at least the next month I will try to put something here whether it is creative or technical who knows.

    This was kind of a mess... I hope I get better.
