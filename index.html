                    I feel good. I think James Brown said something along those lines.

                    For the past week or so coding has felt really easy to do unlike before when I almost never coded. This feels a little bit different from my other times of having motivation. Before, when I had motivation, I would wake up early to go to the gym, uninstall distractions, and stare at the cieling until I would start to do work. Everything was hard, but I would push through it because I wanted to feel productive and I guess I wanted some end goal of a career or something. However, that never really lasted past 2-3 days and it happened once or twice last semester. I could tell it was driven by negative emotions, probably the shame of not being able to do any productive work. But this time it doesnt really feel driven by this same kind of shame. I don't have to force myself to do anything, I just kind of do it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maybe this old motivation was just a stepping stone to what I have now and I don't have proper hindset to tell yet. Maybe I am just coding for the love of the game now. Who knows, I hope this lasts.

                <p>
                    Recently I have been curious about how my skill and confidence has progressed since middle school. Kind of a pointless thought experiment but my gut reaction is that I was much more skilled back in middle school. I used to be able to handle harder competition style questions and my brain worked significantly faster. I remember in 8th grade I believed that all of LC was easy even though I never really tried a question, so perhaps I was just more cocky back then and this is what drives my perception. Right now, my current confidence level is best described by I don't think I will ever have a unique thought lmao.

                    I've been kind of borked by a RSI and I still feel it a little bit but here we are back writing.

                    Recently I have been watching a lot of what Johnathon Blow has to say. He sounds like an absolute goat programmer and I agree with a lot of his ideas so maybe check him out if you're interested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyways, I have been thinking about the cause of my productivity issues that I have struggled with my entire life and I think that I have been able to narrow it down to two causes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One, my dopamine systems are too fried by all of the time that I spent playing video games as as child and the time I spend watching videos now. I think the only real lesson to learn from this one is that I have to be patient with myself when working on my productivity because I am fighting against years of accumulated damage to my brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two, most of my motivation to do work has been due to fear. For example, I have tried hard in school for many years out of fear of getting bad grades. I have spent a lot of time trying to develop marketable skills out of fear of being homeless. I have spent a lot of time on competitions of out of fear of being worse than my pears. Clearly some of these are unavoidable, but I think that if I can find a way to shift off some of my work to a better motivation then this would be healthier.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    This motivation could instead to be closer to the person that I think would be happier. I have no clue if I would actually be happier, but the possibility could be enough of a reason to try and push myself. I am still trying to wrap my head around if this idea could be harmful. Oops this idea came out pretty malformed it sounded more grand in my head lol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wonder if the ideas I gave here actually work on practice or if they are just nice theory ideas. My understanding is that theory usually seems solid until you get to the real world where everything is fuzzy and theory falls aparts so suboptimal choices become better than optimal choices.

                <p>8/9/2024</p>
                <p>
                    Everything ends. It feels as if there are hundreds of tiny ropes that are latching onto my chest and tugging at it. It's almost tempting for me to stay where I am. I'm scared of pain. I don't want to let go.

                <p>8/6/2024</p>
                <p>
                    When I first started college, I wanted to be a quant. I felt bad about failing in competitions and I thought that being on top of salary and prestige and working with the people who were able to do what I couldn't do would redeem myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My ideas of what I wanted to do shifted around a lot throughout my time at college including professorship, research scientist, or CEO. However, one thing that was consistent in all of these choices was that I wanted to be one of the best at what I do. I wanted to be world class specifically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But heres another thought: when Linus was asked how someone could become like him one day, he said that they should not try to be like them. They should try to do some work in the things that interest them but they cannot expect to be like him or stallman. Additionally, he suggested that the people who say aim for the stars and at least you will reach the moon are crazy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And, I kind of agree. I had always been one of those people who dreamt as big as possible and settled with my dissapointment. But I think a lot of my unhappiness and unsureness of what I want comes from exactly this. Maybe I should learn what I am interested in and exactly that.

                <h2>Writing</h2>
                <p>8/1/2024</p>
                <p>"Writing is nature's way of letting you know that you how sloppy you thinking is" - Guindon</p>
                <p>
                    Recently I watched one of Leslie Lamport's presentations about coding. He talks bout why we write. We write to think. I want to think. Thus, I must write.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that this quote is impactful because I have experience that a lot myself. I told myself that I understand something but then my understanding was not as good as I thought it was. Writing things down is the ultimate teller of the truth. I can keep deluding myself that I know what I am doing and thinking and talking about but this can never be verified unless I write it down. Also, who knows? Maybe this will make me a better thinker, problem solver, and learner. Why not try :shrug:.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing that I have been interested in recently is Avatar the Last Airbender. I vaguely remember watching this show as a kid, but this never really was that special in my memories. However, now with this rewatch, I began to appreciate it a bit more. It is amusing to see a lot of the plot points and guessing at what will happen in the future. It kind of reminds me of the sterile problems we are handed in school. The problems are well constructed and guide you towards the answer and you can tell that someone put a lot of effort to make it instructive. Playing around with this idea made me realize that in a way, creative story wrtiting is a lot like coding. There are a lot of different levels of abstractions and each of them affect each other. For example, the way you phrase your sentences (at the writing technique level) affects the perception of your characters (at the per character level). Each of the individual characters combined with the way that they interact affects the way that the world is percieved (at the story level). This was kind of a poor description but I hope the idea is there. It takes a lot of problem solving to make sure that the story goes just right, which feels exactly like coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also wanted to be a bit more creative. I have tried many times to do something creative but it usually falls short. Who knows, maybe it will work this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For these reasons, I am going to try to write a little bit. Maybe what I put here will be not exactly writing, but I want to produce something instead of always consuming. Every week for at least the next month I will try to put something here whether it is creative or technical who knows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was kind of a mess... I hope I get better.
